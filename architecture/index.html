				<li>Now I could show you Cockpit all day ... there's so many cool
				features configuring storage, starting services, docker containers,
				looking through logs But what I'm really excited is about how
				Cockpit works And it's in the title of the talk ... cockpit is a
				Linux session<li>
				<li>Now Linux session is a bit of a vague term ... but I'm talking
				about this in the sense of an X11 login session or an SSH login
				session.</li>
				<li>Cockpit is a login session that runs in your browser.</li>
				<li>Most of Cockpit is written in javascript, and that javascript
				code is running in a logged in linux session, both from a security
				perspective, from XXXXX</li>

		APIs
		SLIDE:
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>A linux system, especially modern Linux has many APIs for
				configuring aspects of the system.</li>

				<li>Some of the APIs are obvious, DBus apis or REST apis. systemd is
				a good example It has a DBus API for doing all sorts of stuff. The
				hostname changes previously was implemented by calling the system
				hostnamed API.</li>

				<li>Other APIs aren't so obvious, accessing them may involve spawning
				a process, or reading a file such as the ones in /proc</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section data-background-video="dbus-proxy.webm">
		<!-- TODO: Perhaps an introduction slide? -->
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>Here's an example of the hostnamed call we made earlier. I'm
				typing javascript code directly in the interactive console on my
				browser here. If you have Cockpit running on your system try this.</li>

				<li>It's trivial to interact with the APIs, easier even than if you
				were on the system itself ... but that's the point ... we are on
				the system ... logged into the system ... and the javascript code
				here is running as part of the login session.</li>

				<li>This is what got me excited about Cockpit. Now when I started
				hacking on it it couldn't do all of this stuff ... but the very idea
				that there was code in the browser interacting directly with the system
				cutting through the usual layers of crap ... and really makes building
				admin tools fun again.</li>

				ping.</li>

				it in real time.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Bridge</li>
				<li>IMAGE: Updated</li>
				<li>Well if you're logged into Cockpit and look closely ... you'll
				notice there's a process called cockpit-bridge</li>

				<li>cockpit-bridge doesn't know anything about configuring a system
				it knows how to process messages. The bridge receives messages
				on its standard in ... and produces messages on its stdout. A
				message might be about invoking a dbus method, or spawing a process
				or reading a file</li>

				<li>and it produces messages with the results asynchronously ... The
				javascript code running in the browser reacts to those messages
				and can carry out the actions it needs to.</li>
			</ul>

	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		Web Service
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>IMAGE: Updated</li>
				<li>Now obviously the browser cannot talk directly with the bridge
				on standard in and standard out.</li>

				<li>Enter the WebSocket ... The cockpit-ws process makes a WebSocket
				available for the browser to talk to ... and any messages passed
				over the WebSocket are passed to the bridge and vice versa.</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		HTTP
			IMAGE: Updated
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>One last piece ... how does the javascript code that comprises
				Cockpit get to the browser? Well iva HTTP, cockpit-ws has a small
				web server that loads Cockpit into the browser once you're logged in.</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		Authentication and Identity

		SLIDE:
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>Now you may be wondering about security ... this all sounds pretty
				wild ... browsers authenticating with the system.</li>

				<li>Lets start with authentication</li>

				<li>A key component of a login session is its identity ... who are you
				logged in as When you log in via ssh ... sshd authenticates you in
				the sshd process and then starts the shell with a specific uid and gid</li>

				<li>When your browser first connects to Cockpit it won't just let you
				open the WebSocket launch the bridge and start passing messages to
				access the system APIs ... it requires that you log in first.</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section data-background-video="login-process.webm">
		<!-- TODO: -->
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>The user name and password that you type here is passed into the
				PAM stack, which checks auth ... then access ... whether you're allowed
				to log in ... creates a pam session, including SELinux session, logind
				session ... and then launches the bridge inside that cockpit-bridge</li>

				<li>Here's the terminal we have inside of Cockpit. You can see what the
				session looks like and that we're logged in as a specific user.</li>

				<li>So that's why I can stand here and say "the javascript code is part of
				the login session" Everything the code does to the system goes through
				the bridge ... and the bridge can only perform those operations as the
				logged in user. So the javascript code really is running *AS* the logged
				in user.</li>

				<li>When Cockpit needs to do something with evelevated privileges ... it
				uses sudo or polkit depending on the scenario ... and that only succeeds
				if the system allowed you to perform that operation.xxxxxxx</li>

		Content-Security-Policy

		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>Now if you're running javascript *AS* the logged in user ... you want
				to be damn sure that only the code that was intended to run gets run
				... and that nobody can sneak code in via MITM or XSS or request forgeries</li>

				<li>Nowadays browsers have this thing called Content Security Policy
				... which if you're not familiar with it is sorta like SELinux for
				browser content.</li>
			</ul>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->

		IMAGE:
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>You can tell the browser to refuse to execute code from any other
				source than the server. If you have an onclick attribute or eval of
				some string ... or an inline script tag it's just not going to run.</li>

				<li>So we can really underscore the concept that the code is running as
				the user and only the users code is running.</li>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		Plugabbility
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>One of teh things you typically expect of a login session is the
				ability to run different tools or applications. A login session is not
				a kiosk. On your desktop you can run various applications, and usually
				install and remove them ... and when you login via SSH it's a similar
				story you can add or even build tools to run.</li>

				<li>Cockpit is componentized and pluggable the same way. Each section you
				see here is really running as a separate browser based application ...
				loosely coupled. They often come in different subpackages (RPMs) and
				are installable and removable.</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		VIDEO: pluggable
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>In fact it's easy to build your own bits of UI that interact with
				your custom admin scripts or other tooling. Here's the full text of
				such a tool, and here is it running.</li>

	<section data-background-video="gtk-broadway.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>You can even do some pretty wild things like running GTK apps. This
				is broadway, and these apps are really running in the browser. GTK
				supports HTML5 based rendering, and Cockpit provides the login
				session and authentication to wrap it all together. This is just an
				example, but I hope it proves my point.</li>

	<section data-background-video="multiple-hosts.webm">
		<!-- TODO: -->
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>One of the cooler things about Cockpit is that it can connect out
				to other servers via SSH ... even if those servers are not accessible
				to the browser. They may be behind a firewall and you may have a
				bastion host ... or simply don't want to open up the additional
				TCP port to allow the browser to connect to Cockpit.</li>

				<li>Cockpit connects out to those servers via ssh, using password, 
				based auth and others</li>

	<section>
		<!-- TODO: -->
		IMAGE: full architecture
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>The same cockpit-bridge is launched as it was earlier ... but in
				this case it's launched over SSH, which starts the session as the
				appropriate user, and we talk to the bridge over standard in and
				standard out as before.</li>

		Declarative vs. Interactive
		SLIDE: text
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>Now obviously you don't want to do this with thousands of servers.
				And that's where I want to highlight the difference between declarative
				and interactive configuration.</li>
				<li>With declarative configuration you define the state you want, and
				then say "Mkae it so" or "make 10 of these" and the management system
				executes your wishes. That's what you want with thousands of servers.</li>
				<li>Interactive is a different use case, where you troubleshoot
				interactively, maybe do some configuration interactively and so on.</li>
				<li>Sometimes the use cases overlap, where you might want to interactively
				troubleshoot a server that Puppet or Satetelite has deployed in a
				declarative manner.</li>
